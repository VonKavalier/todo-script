# todo-script
Basic bash function to edit my TODO file

## How to install :
- Simply put the function in your `~/.bashrc` or such
- Do `source ~/.bashrc` to reload your shell

## How to use :
- Run `todo` and the file will open with vim (as default)
- You can specify an editor with `todo <editor name>` such as `subl` or `gedit`.

## What now ?
- Feel free to modify it and do anything you want, you don't even have to quote me :)
